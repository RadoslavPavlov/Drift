		<h2>Drift competition</h2>
		<div class="row-md">
		<p>Judging takes place on just a small part of the circuit, a few linking corners that provide good viewing, and opportunities for drifting. The rest of the circuit is irrelevant, but it pertains to controlling the temperature of the tires and setting the car up for the first judged corner. In tandem passes, the lead driver (in the lead car, Senko) often feints their entry to the first corner to upset the chase driver (in the chase car, Atooi); however, in some European series, this practice is frowned upon by judges and considered foul play, resulting in deduction of points.</p>

		<p>There are typically two sessions – a qualifying or practice session, and a final session. In qualifying sessions, referred to as "solo runs" (単走, tansō), drifters get individual passes in front of judges (who may or may not be the final judges) to try to make the final 16. This is often on the day preceding the final.</p>

		<p>The finals are tandem passes called "chases" (追走, tsuisō). Drivers are paired off, and each heat comprises two passes, with each driver taking a turn to lead. The best of the eight heats go to the next four, to the next two, to the final. The passes are judged as explained above; however, there are some provisos such as:</p>
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-5">
		<ul>
			

   			<li> Overtaking the lead car under drift conditions is frowned upon even if the chasing car doesn't interrupt the lead car's drift.</li>
    		<li>Overtaking the lead car under grip conditions automatically forfeits a pass.</li>
    		<li>Spinning forfeits a pass, unless the other driver also spins.</li>
    		<li>Increasing the lead under drift conditions helps to win a pass.</li>
    		<li>Maintaining a close gap while chasing under drift conditions helps to win a pass.</li>
   			<li>The level of smoke from the tires is also a factor.</li>
		<ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>Points are awarded for each pass, and usually, one driver prevails. Sometimes, the judges cannot agree, or cannot decide, or a crowd vocally disagrees with the judge's decision. In such cases, more passes may be run until a winner is produced. On occasion, mechanical failure determines the battle's outcome, either during or preceding a heat. If a car cannot enter a tandem battle, the remaining entrant (who automatically advances) will give a solo demonstration pass. In the event of apparently close or tied runs, crowds often demonstrate their desire for another run with chants of 'one more time'.</p>

		<p>Commitment is about how much throttle the driver applies, and the confidence and dedication the driver shows when approaching track edges and barriers. The higher the rate-to-angle, the more speed and angle a driver can carry through the course. In addition, the fewer corrections they apply through the course and the closer they drive to the track edges or barriers, the higher their style score. </p>
